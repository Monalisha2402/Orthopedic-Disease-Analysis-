# Orthopedic-Disease-Analysis-

## Introduction:

The escalating prevalence of orthopedic diseases underscores the importance of a comprehensive understanding to enable effective treatment. Orthopedics has permeated daily life and gained widespread significance. Notably, Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis stand out as two prevalent orthopedic conditions.

## Project Scope:

This project delves into the analysis of orthopedic patients' conditions through the application of machine learning techniques.

## key Highlights:

1. Embracing Orthopedics in Daily Life: The growing impact of orthopedic diseases underscores the urgency of detailed insights.

2. Focused Disease Study: Our study hones in on two common orthopedic ailments, Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis, seeking to unravel their complexities.

3. Classification Tasks: Patient data is systematically organized into two classification tasks. In the first task, patients are classified into Normal, Disk Hernia, or Spondylolisthesis categories. In the second task, we amalgamate Disk Hernia and Spondylolisthesis into a single 'Abnormal' category, distinguishing patients as Normal or Abnormal.

4. Data Source: Leveraging the resources of the UCI Machine Learning Repository [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml], our analysis draws from a robust dataset.

## Project Goals:

    1. Develop a nuanced understanding of orthopedic diseases.
    2. Apply data analysis techniques to classify patients based on distinct disease categories.
    3. Provide insights that can potentially enhance diagnosis and treatment protocols.
    4. Contribute to the broader medical field by utilizing data-driven approaches.
    5. By undertaking this project, we endeavor to shed light on the intricate landscape of orthopedic diseases, empowering 
       healthcare professionals with valuable tools for informed decision-making and improved patient care.
